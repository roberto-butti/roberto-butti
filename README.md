### Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roberto Butti.
I love building OpenSource projects.

__Language/Runtime__ : PHP, Javascript/Typescript, Node.js, Python

__Framework/Libraries__ : Laravel, Vue.js, React.js, Livewire, Flask

I'm currently working on some OpenSource "side projects":
- [LaraLens](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/lara-lens): is a __Laravel__ package to show you the current configuration of your application. You can get the following details from an Artisan command;
- [Milk SDK PHP](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/milk-sdk-php): is a PHP open source package SDK to connect/use and consume Geolocation services. I'm focusing on HERE Technologies services like Data HUB, Routing API, Geocoding API, Isoline API. I'm planning also to exetend the support for other providers;
- [RandoPHP](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/rando-php): is a PHP open source package that implements random generators (Integer, Char, Byte, Float, Geocoordinates etc.) and takes random samples from arrays. This package can be broken down into two distinct types of operations: generating things and drawing from existing arrays;
- [Fit Geojson](https://github.com/roberto-butti/fit-geojson-vuejs): is a Web application to Parse __FIT__ and/or __GPX__ files and convert them into __Geojson__ file.

I love also to contribute to __OpenSource projects__, creating Pull Request for adding new features and/or fixing bugs:
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows): creating new CI/CD template workflow for Laravel applications;
- [Laravel 8](https://github.com/laravel/framework): fix a bug in schema dump;
- [HERE CLI](https://github.com/heremaps/here-cli): implemented a new option to manage GPX file and upload it on Data HUB;
- [DB Dumper](https://github.com/spatie/db-dumper): adding options for MySql dump;
- [Drupal Console](https://github.com/hechoendrupal/drupal-console): fix some option for sqlite;
- [Laravel Backpack / CRUD](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD): italian translation;
- [Laravel Backpack / Permission Manager](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/PermissionManager): added italian translation;
- ... more
