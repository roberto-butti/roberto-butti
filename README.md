### Hi Folks üëã

My name is Roberto Butti.
I love building OpenSource projects.

__Language/Runtime__ : PHP, Javascript

__Framework/Libraries__ : Laravel, SvelteKit

I'm currently working on some OpenSource "side projects":

- üìñ [Ibis Next](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/ibis-next): a PHP tool that helps you write eBooks in markdown and convert to PDF and EPUB
- üìñ [Some drops of PHP](https://github.com/roberto-butti/some-drops-of-php): I wrote an open source eBook about PHP. You can read the [HTML - eBook](https://drops-of-php.hi-folks.dev/);
- üìñ [Some drops of JavaScript](https://github.com/roberto-butti/some-drops-of-javascript): I'm writing an open source eBook about JavaScript. You can read the [HTML - eBook](https://some-drops-of-javascript.vercel.app/);

- [RandoPHP](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/rando-php): is a PHP open source package that implements random generators (Integer, Char, Byte, Float, Geocoordinates etc.) and takes random samples from arrays. This package can be broken down into two distinct types of operations: generating things and drawing from existing arrays;
