### Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roberto Butti.
I love building OpenSource projects.
I'm Developer Relations Engineer ðŸ¥‘

__Language/Runtime__ : PHP, Javascript/Typescript, Node.js, Python

__Framework/Libraries__ : Laravel, Vue.js, React.js, Livewire, Flask

I'm currently working on some OpenSource "side projects":
- ðŸ“– [50 drops of PHP](https://github.com/roberto-butti/50-drops-of-php): I wrote an open source book about PHP. You can download the [PDF format - eBook](https://hifolks.gumroad.com/l/50-drops-of-php);
- [Ghygen: Laravel Github Actions Workflow Generator](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/gh-actions-yaml-generator): is a web application for creating Github Actions Workflow Yaml file. You can define your PHP stack, setup a database, run migrations, run unit and features tests, run browser tests via Laravel Dusk, build assets (via Node), perform code checks (phpcs, phpstan, phpunit); 
- [LaraLens](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/lara-lens): is a __Laravel__ package to show you the current configuration of your application. You can get the following details from an Artisan command;
- [Milk SDK PHP](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/milk-sdk-php): is a PHP open source package SDK to connect/use and consume Geolocation services. I'm focusing on HERE Technologies services like Data HUB, Routing API, Geocoding API, Isoline API. I'm planning also to exetend the support for other providers;
- [RandoPHP](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/rando-php): is a PHP open source package that implements random generators (Integer, Char, Byte, Float, Geocoordinates etc.) and takes random samples from arrays. This package can be broken down into two distinct types of operations: generating things and drawing from existing arrays;
- [Fit Geojson](https://github.com/roberto-butti/fit-geojson-vuejs): is a Web application to Parse __FIT__ and/or __GPX__ files and convert them into __Geojson__ file.

I love also to contribute to __OpenSource projects__, creating Pull Request for adding new features and/or fixing bugs:
