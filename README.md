__Language/Runtime__ : PHP, Javascript (Bunjs)

I'm currently working on some OpenSource "side projects":

- üï∏Ô∏è [Fusion](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/fusion): Fusion is a Laravel package designed to manage Markdown content via Eloquent Models.
- üìñ [Ibis Next](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/ibis-next): a PHP tool that helps you write eBooks in markdown and convert to PDF and EPUB
- üìñ [Some drops of PHP](https://github.com/roberto-butti/some-drops-of-php): I wrote an open source eBook about PHP. You can read the [HTML - eBook](https://drops-of-php.hi-folks.dev/);
- üìñ [Some drops of JavaScript](https://github.com/roberto-butti/some-drops-of-javascript): I'm writing an open source eBook about JavaScript. You can read the [HTML - eBook](https://some-drops-of-javascript.vercel.app/);

You can define your PHP stack, setup a database, run migrations, run unit and features tests, run browser tests via Laravel Dusk, build assets (via Node), perform code checks (phpcs, phpstan, phpunit);
- [Arr and Table package](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/array/): Arr and Table class is built on top of the PHP array functions. Arr and Table exposes methods for creating, managing, accessing to the array data structure;

This package can be broken down into two distinct types of operations: generating things and drawing from existing arrays;
